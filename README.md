# challenge-19-budget-tracker

## In this application we are working with the Service Worker to deploy an offline application.

## Our application is budget tracket that allows the user to input additions or expenses to ones current budget. Once a user inputs an addition then it is displayed on a graph. Once the user adds an expense, then the application shows a downward sloping graph.

## In order to validate the the offline usage of the application, we open up the console and enable offline mode using the network tab. It is validated if we are able to use the application on offline mode.
